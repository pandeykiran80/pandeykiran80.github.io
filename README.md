# About Me
Driven by a deep curiosity for the Earth's inner workings, I enthusiastically explore the captivating fields of earthquakes and volcanoes. As a Ph.D. student at the prestigious Center for Earthquake Research and Information (CERI) at the University of Memphis, my research focuses on the intricate domains of earthquake precursors, repeaters, and volcano tectonics.
Through rigorous seismic velocity analysis and comprehensive investigations of fault repeaters, my primary objective is to uncover the intricate mechanisms underlying fault failures. I employ a range of methodologies, including laboratory experiments, meticulous analytical and numerical models, and rigorous statistical analyses. By leveraging these multifaceted approaches, I strive to advance the existing body of knowledge in these specialized domains. Furthermore, I harness the remarkable capabilities of machine learning to accurately classify volcano-tectonic events, thereby deepening our understanding of these natural phenomena.
Together, let us collaborate and make meaningful contributions towards the development of effective hazard mitigation strategies, creating a safer world for all.
